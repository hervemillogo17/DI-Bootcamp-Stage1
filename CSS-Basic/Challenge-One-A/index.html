        <b>S</b>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        <b>A</b>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd,<br>
        <b>A</b>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>

        <b>N</b>or shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br>
        <b>W</b>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br>
        <b>S</b>o long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
        <b>S</b>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
